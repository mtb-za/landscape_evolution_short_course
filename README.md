This repository was created following a short course in Numerical Modelling using Landscape Evolution as an Example which was held at [Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University](http://www.nmmu.ac.za) during the 2 - 5 May 2016.
The course was presented by [Prof Jean Braun](jeaun.braun@ujf-grenoble.fr) of [Universit√© Grenoble Alps](http://www.univ-grenoble-alpes.fr/en/)' Institute of Earth Sciences ([ISTerre](https://isterre.fr/?lang=en)).

The [notebook](./notebook/) folder contains my own notes interspersed with Python code, written in a Jupyter notebook during the course as to how some of the stuff works. This will generate a simple model either with a central peak or a east-west ridge, and show the effect of including diffusion off hillslopes. The easiest way to view this without pulling the repo is using its link at [nbviewer.jupyter.org](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mtb-za/landscape_evolution_short_course/blob/master/notebooks/FastScape.ipynb). More extensive notes and lecture slides compiled by Prof Braun can be found [here](../notes/), although I think I managed to get most of it.

If you just want some code to run (without much in the way of explanation), have a look in the [scripts](./scripts/) folder. `cyc_fastscape.py` will generate a ridgeline, `fastscape.py` will generate a central peak. Example scripts, written by Prof Braun are located in [another folder](./braun_scripts/). There are versions in Python, R, Fortran 90, and SciLab (which is a MatLab clone, and should work in the standard Matlab IDE).

If you have a use for this sort of modelling, Prof Braun has made a Fortran programme available, called [FastScape](./braun_scripts/fastscape.tar.gz). For information on getting this working, please [contact him](jeaun.braun@ujf-grenoble.fr), since I have not tried using this yet. It uses [ParaView](http://www.paraview.org/) for visualisation.
