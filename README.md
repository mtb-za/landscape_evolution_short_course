This repository was created following a short course in Numerical Modelling using Landscape Evolution as an Example which was held at [Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University](http://www.nmmu.ac.za) during the 2 - 5 May 2016.
The course was presented by [Prof Jean Braun](jeaun.braun@ujf-grenoble.fr) of Universit√© Grenoble Alps.

The `./notebook/` folder contains my own notes, written in the notebook during the course as to how some of the stuff works. It also contains the code, (in Python) at least as far as we went with it. This will generate a simple model either with a central peak or a east-west ridge.

If you just want some code to run (without much in the way of explanation), have a look in the `./scripts/` folder.

If you have a use for this sort of modelling, Prof Braun has made a Fortran programme available, called FastScape. This uses Paraview for visualisation.
